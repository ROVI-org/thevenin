## Summary
This package is a wrapper for the well-known Thevenin equivalent circuit model. The model is comprised of a single series reistor followed by any number of parallel RC pairs. Figure 1 below illustrates a circuit with 2 RC pairs; however, the model can be run with as few as zero, and as many as $N$.

This system is governed by the evolution of the state of charge (SOC, -), RC overpotentials ($V_j$, V), cell voltage ($V_{\rm cell}$, V), and temperature ($T_{\rm cell}$, K). SOC and $V_j$ evolve in time as
```math
\begin{align}
  &\frac{d\rm SOC}{dt} = \frac{-I}{3600 Q_{\rm max}}, \\
  &\frac{dV_j}{dt} = -\frac{V_j}{R_jC_j} + \frac{I}{C_j},
\end{align}
```
where $I$ is the load current (A), $Q_{\rm max}$ is the maximum nominal cell capacity (Ah), and $R_j$ and $C_j$ are the resistance (Ohm) and capacitance (F) of each RC pair $j$. Note that the sign convention for $I$ is chosen such that positive $I$ discharges the battery (reduces SOC) and negative $I$ charges the battery (increases SOC). This convention is consistent with common physics-based models, e.g., the single particle model or pseudo-2D model. While not explicitly included in the equations above, $R_j$ and $C_j$ are functions of SOC and $T_{\rm cell}$. The temperature increases while the cell is active according to
```math
\begin{equation}
  mC_p\frac{dT_{\rm cell}}{dt} = \dot{Q}_{\rm gen} + \dot{Q}_{\rm conv},
\end{equation}
```
where $m$ is mass (kg), $C_p$ is specific heat capacity (J/kg/K), $Q_{\rm gen}$ is the heat generation (W), and $Q_{\rm conv}$ is the convective heat loss (W). Heat generation and convection are defined by
```math
\begin{align}
  &\dot{Q}_{\rm gen} = I \times (V_{\rm OCV}({\rm SOC}) - V_{\rm cell}), \\
  &\dot{Q}_{\rm conv} = hA(T_{\infty} - T_{\rm cell}),
\end{align}
```
where $h$ is the convecitive heat transfer coefficient (W/m<sup>2</sup>/K), $A$ is heat loss area (m<sup>2</sup>), and $T_{\infty}$ is the air/room temperature (K). $V_{\rm OCV}$ is the open circuit voltage (V) and is a function of SOC.

The overall cell voltage is
```math
\begin{equation}
  V_{\rm cell} = V_{\rm OCV}({\rm SOC}) - \sum_j V_j - IR_0,
\end{equation}
```
where $R_0$ is the lone series resistance (Ohm), as shown in Figure 1. Just like the other resistive elements, $R_0$ is a function of SOC and $T_{\rm cell}$.

## Installation
`thevenin` is installable via either pip or conda. To install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/thevenin) use the following command.

```
pip install thevenin
```

If you prefer using the `conda` package manager, you can install `thevenin` from the `conda-forge` channel using the command below.

```
conda install -c conda-forge thevenin
```

If you run into issues with installation due to the [scikit-sundae](https://github.com/NREL/scikit-sundae) dependency, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/NREL/scikit-sundae/issues). We also manage this solver package, but distribute it separately since it is not developed in pure Python.

For those interested in setting up a developer and/or editable version of this software please see the directions available in the "Development" section of our [documentation](https://thevenin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development).

## Get Started
The API is organized around three main classes that allow you to construct the model, define an experiment, and interact with the solution. A basic example for a constant-current discharge is given below. To learn more about the model and see more detailed examples check out the [documentation](https://thevenin.readthedocs.io/) on Read the Docs.

```python
import thevenin as thev

model = thev.Model()

expr = thev.Experiment()
expr.add_step('current_A', 75., (3600., 1.), limits=('voltage_V', 3.))

soln = model.run(expr)
soln.plot('time_h', 'voltage_V')
```
